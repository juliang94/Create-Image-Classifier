# Flower-Image-Classifier
Second project from Udacity

In this project, I train an image classifier to recognize different flower species. This is analogous to a phone app that tells you the name of the flower the camera is looking at. After training this classifier, I export it for use in an application by running it in a command line environment. The dataset consists of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.


The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1 - Load and preprocess the image dataset.   
2 - Train the image classifier on your dataset.   
3 - Use the trained classifier to predict image content.   


The classifier in the application phase can be trained on any set of labeled images. The neural network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. For instance, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it.
